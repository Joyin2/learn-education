## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js 15**: App Router with TypeScript
- **Firebase 12.0.0**: Firestore + Authentication
- **React 19**: Hooks and Context API
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped component styling
- **Font Awesome**: Icon integration

### Key Features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Real-time Data**: Live updates in admin dashboard
- **Security First**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Loading States**: Smooth user experience with loading indicators

## 🚀 Next Steps Required

### 1. Firebase Console Setup (5 minutes)
1. Apply Firestore security rules from `firestore.rules`
2. Create admin user account in Firebase Authentication
