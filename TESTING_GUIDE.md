2. **Contact form not submitting**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Firebase configuration
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Admin login not working**
   - Verify admin user exists in Firebase Auth
   - Check credentials are correct
   - Look for authentication errors in console

4. **Dashboard not loading submissions**
   - Verify Firestore has data
   - Check authentication state
   - Look for query errors in console

### Debug Tools:
- Browser Developer Tools (Console, Network, Application tabs)
- Firebase Console (Authentication, Firestore, Usage tabs)
- React Developer Tools (for component state)

## 📞 Support
If any tests fail, check the browser console for detailed error messages and refer to the troubleshooting section in `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.
